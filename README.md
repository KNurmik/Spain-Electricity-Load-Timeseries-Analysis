The purpose of this project was to design solutions which are effectively able to model electricity load time series data from Spain. We do so by proposing a model staircase of linear regression, gaussian processes, a recurrent neural network using gated recurrent units, and the "All You Need Is Attention" transformer adapted for time series. The models use the load data from the past 48 hours to predict load for the next 24 hours.

This project was created as part of JSC370: Data Science II at the University of Toronto by Karl Hendrik Nurmeots and Samuel Vedrik. The starter code for the project was created by David Duvenaud and Harsh Panchal.
